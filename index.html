  <div class="about">
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation tasks, but their performance in personalized long-text generation remains largely unexplored. While recent works have focused on personalization for short-text generation, there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to long-text generation, considering its widespread real-world applications.</p>
    <p>LongLaMP aims to fill this gap by providing a benchmark specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating personalized, long-text outputs. It is a collection of datasets spanning diverse domains, each focused on the challenging task of long-text generation.
